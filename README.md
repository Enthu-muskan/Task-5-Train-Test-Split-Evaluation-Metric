# Task-5-Train-Test-Split-Evaluation-Metric
Description

This project demonstrates the use of train-test split and model evaluation using the Heart Disease dataset. A Logistic Regression model is trained and evaluated using standard performance metrics.

Dataset

Heart Disease Dataset (UCI / OpenML) loaded using sklearn.

Tools Used

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Steps Performed

Loaded the Heart Disease dataset.

Split data into training and testing sets.

Trained a Logistic Regression model.

Predicted results on test data.

Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

Confusion Matrix

Conclusion

The model shows good performance and generalizes well on unseen data, demonstrating effective model evaluation fundamentals.
